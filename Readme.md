<h3 align="center">why you are the best candidate for the position.</h3>
<br>
Because I love to learn new skills, keep improving in what I know, and I've always loved to create unique designs. I've learned front and back end, but if I'm honest, I've always had a preference for front-end because I like to take time to make the page as attractive as I can for the client. I also enjoy working in a team and can speak fluent Spanish too.
<br><br>

<h3 align="center">What was your last (or current) job position? Title? Daily tasks? Accomplishments?</h3>
<br>
I was a Full-stack Teaching Assistant at Soy Henry (which is a teaching academy where I also learned most of my skills), which provided me with a group to lead and guide through their first steps in the programming industry. Every day, we would meet online to discuss what they learned during the day, and I would be there to correct any coding issues they had and help them understand any concepts they found difficult in class.
<br><br>

<h3 align="center">What is the accomplishment you are most proud of?</h3>
<br>
Mostly, I'm proud of how far I've come in the programming field. When I started, I was lost in this new world and couldn't imagine reaching this level of knowledge and learning so many things. I have learned how to work with amazing people and manage multiple languages with ease. Therefore, I will continue moving forward to keep making myself proud of my achievements.
<br><br>

<h3 align="center">How would you handle a situation where another team member was critical of your work?</h3>
<br>
Well, I believe that each comment about my work would help me grow professionally. If someone does criticize my work, I would listen to him/her and accept their opinion. Then, I would assess how to improve my work, keeping in mind what they told me.
<br><br>

<h3 align="center">With projects you've worked on in the past, what SEO and ADA principles, if any, did you factor in with your work? Do you have any experience or knowledge of other online marketing work?</h3>
<br>
What I have learned since I started working in teams has mostly been soft skills, such as effective technical communication for better understanding and discovering easier ways to solve problems.
<br>
Before I learned programming, I used to create website designs in Figma and sell them. I focused on creating the layout only. When I started learning programming, I developed several websites using pure HTML and CSS, including a hotel website.
<br><br>

<h3 align="center">What experience do you have with development? Could you please list the tech stacks you have the most experience in, from coding languages to content management systems to SysAdmin technologies?</h3>
<br>
I have created a video game page and other projects with React. Some examples include a page about the TV shows "Rick and Morty" and "Game of Thrones," as well as an e-commerce website for sportswear. In the e-commerce project, I managed and led the team through the entire project, overseeing both the frontend and backend development.
<br>
However, my main focus in these projects was on the frontend. I worked on creating the design and ensuring it was responsive for a higher user experience. Creating the following pages in the client view:
<br>
-Landing page: This page showcased featured products and provided a description of the website.
-Log in and log out functionality: Users were able to log in using their Google accounts, and their information was saved in the database.
-Client Profile: Users had the ability to edit their account information and delete their account if desired.
<br><br>
In the admin view, I created the following pages:
<br>
-Products page: This page displayed all the products that the admin had created. The admin could create new products, edit existing ones, delete any product, and select products to feature on the landing page.
-Users page: This page showed all the subscribed users and their activity on the platform, such as purchase history, frequency of platform visits, and any comments they made about the products they purchased.
-Dashboard page: This page provided information on the number of products sold, statistics on the best-selling products, the total number of users, and the frequency of user visits to the website.
